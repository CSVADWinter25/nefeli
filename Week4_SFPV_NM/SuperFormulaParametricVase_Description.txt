This parametric vase design builds upon the ParaForm1 example from class by incorporating the superformula algorithm, inspired by a previous p5.js experiment. While maintaining the basic vessel structure with quad strips, the design expands the original form's possibilities through several controllable parameters. The main constraints remain in the basic vase structure - it must stay hollow and maintain its vertical construction. The degrees of freedom come from two sources: first, from the original ParaForm1 parameters like height, radius, wave effect, and top/bottom openings; and second, from the added superformula parameters (y, z, n1, n2, n3) which create more complex and organic cross-sectional shapes. These parameters work together to allow the vase to transform from simple cylindrical shapes to more complex, asymmetric forms while still functioning as a container.
