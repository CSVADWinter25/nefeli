I was drawn to Morse code because of its inherent simplicity—just dots and dashes—and the way it still carries meaning through repetition. By repeating the Morse for “Hello World!” in a grid, I amplified that simplicity into a larger pattern, adding complexity by rotating every other column. Adjusting both the grid size and the text size alters the balance between order and visual density, while experimenting with different rotational offsets adds another layer of variety. The result is a design that feels both structured and dynamic, revealing how even a minimal symbol system can produce a compelling visual pattern when replicated and transformed.
