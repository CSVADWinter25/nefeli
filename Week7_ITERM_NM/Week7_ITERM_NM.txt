This interactive extension transforms the termite system into a dynamic drawing tool where human input directly influences the emergent patterns. When the user clicks and holds the mouse, the simulation enters a hybrid state where the agents' behavior shifts from their autonomous exploration to a guided movement pattern. In this interactive mode, agents within a defined radius of the mouse position are attracted to it, creating a local tendril effect while still maintaining their individual trail-leaving behaviors. This creates an interesting tension between the natural behaviors of the system and human control. Instead of setting strict boundaries, the user guides groups of agents. They influence how these groups behave while still allowing new patterns to develop. The result is a collaborative drawing process where the final output emerges from the interplay between human intent and the agents' autonomous behaviors. The system keeps its key stigmergic features, meaning that agents still respond to and leave trails. Now, these features can be intentionally shaped by human input. This allows for a connection between autonomous generative art and traditional drawing. The use of a mouse acts as another environmental force, different from the Perlin noise field. It enables careful composition while still maintaining the natural and emerging qualities of the original system.
